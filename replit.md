# RAML to Flask API Generator

## Overview

This is a Streamlit-based web application that automatically generates production-ready Flask REST APIs from RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) specifications. The tool parses RAML 1.0 files and creates a complete Flask application with proper project structure, models, schemas, services, and API routes. Additionally, it generates comprehensive Python client libraries with pytest test suites for end-to-end API development workflow.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Developer: Ravi Bhushan Konduru (Shan Konduru) - Enterprise Test Automation Architect with 26 years experience.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Streamlit Wizard Interface**: 3-step guided workflow (Upload → Generate → Download)
- **Progress Visualization**: Step-by-step progress bar with visual status indicators
- **Streamlined Configuration**: Essential controls integrated into main interface

### Backend Architecture
- **Parser Module** (`raml_parser.py`): Handles RAML file parsing and validation
- **Code Generator** (`code_generator.py`): Transforms parsed RAML into Flask application code
- **Template Engine**: Uses Jinja2 for generating code from templates

### Generated Flask Application Structure
The tool creates a well-organized Flask application following best practices:
- **Application Factory Pattern**: Modular app initialization
- **Blueprint-based Routing**: Versioned API endpoints
- **Service Layer Architecture**: Business logic separation
- **Model-Schema Pattern**: Data validation and serialization

## Key Components

### 1. RAML Parser (`raml_parser.py`)
- **Purpose**: Converts RAML specifications into structured Python data
- **Features**:
  - YAML parsing and validation
  - Resource extraction (endpoints, methods, parameters)
  - Type definitions processing
  - Security schemes handling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages

### 2. Code Generator (`code_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Transforms parsed RAML into Flask application code
- **Template System**: Jinja2-based code generation with custom filters
- **Generated Components**:
  - Application structure and configuration
  - Database models
  - Request/response schemas
  - Service layer classes
  - API route handlers
  - Configuration files

### 3. Client Generator (`client_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generates Python client libraries with pytest test suites
- **Features**:
  - Requests-based API client classes
  - Type hints and comprehensive error handling
  - Authentication support (API key, basic auth)
  - Complete pytest test suite with mocking
  - Integration tests and examples
  - Ready-to-install package structure

### 4. Streamlit Interface (`app.py`)
- **Purpose**: Provides user-friendly web interface
- **Features**:
  - File upload handling
  - Configuration options (Flask, Client generation)
  - Real-time preview
  - Code download functionality

## Data Flow

1. **File Upload**: User uploads RAML file through Streamlit interface
2. **Parsing**: RAML content is validated and parsed into structured data
3. **Configuration**: User specifies generation options (app name, version, features)
4. **Code Generation**: Parser output is transformed into Flask application files
5. **Output**: Generated code is packaged and made available for download

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Streamlit**: Web interface framework
- **PyYAML**: RAML/YAML file parsing
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for code generation

### Generated Application Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework for generated APIs
- **Flask-JWT-Extended**: JWT authentication (optional)
- **Flask-CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing (optional)
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM (implied)
- **Marshmallow**: Schema validation and serialization (implied)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Streamlit development server
- **File-based Operation**: No persistent storage required
- **In-memory Processing**: RAML parsing and code generation

### Generated Application Deployment
The tool creates Flask applications designed for:
- **Local Development**: Built-in Flask development server
- **Production Deployment**: WSGI-compatible structure
- **Database Migration**: Alembic migration support
- **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration test structure

### Configuration Management
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Separate settings for development, testing, and production
- **Modular Extensions**: Optional features (JWT, CORS) can be enabled/disabled
- **Version Management**: API versioning support through blueprint structure
